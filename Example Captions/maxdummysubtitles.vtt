00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50%
- So what's the plan?

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50%
- ICU when we can get a bed
and admit for supportive care.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50%
Repeat head CT in three hours.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50%
Or sooner, if he blows a pupil.

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50%
- Want a Keppra load?
- Order's already in.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50%
Nice job.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50%
- Do you think he'll wake up?

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50%
- Maybe.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50%
Maybe not.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50%
- No good deed goes unpunished.

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50%
- Oh, has anyone,
um, notified the family?

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50%
I could try.

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.900 position:50%
- Otis Williams.
Healthy 31-year-old.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50%
V-tach arrest
two weeks after triathlon.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50%
NSR with one shock.

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50%
- Pulse 98, BP 110 over 60.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50%
- He's a little young
for an MI.

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50%
- Exactly right,

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50%
What's in the differential,
Dr. Collins?

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50%
- Drug overdose,
electrolytes, long QT--

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50%
ooh, Brugada syndrome, WPW...

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50%
- How you doing there, Otis?

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50%
- OK.
What ha--

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50%
[machine flatlines]
- V-tach again.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50%
- 200 joules.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50%
[whirring]
- Charged, and clear!

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50%
- Back in sinus.
[steady beeping]

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50%
Otis?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50%
- [groaning]

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50%
- Otis?

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50%
- Oh, groaning's good.
5 of nasal O2, CBC,

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50%
CMP, troponin, and D-dimer.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.606 position:50%
What are you doing?

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50%
- One gram calcium gluconate,
IV push.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50%
- We don't have the labs back.
- Look at the monitor.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50%
Widened QRS and PT waves.

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50%
Hyperkalemia.
- How'd he get that?

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50%
- Intense exercise
caused muscle breakdown.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50%
Rhabdomyolysis knocked out
his kidneys.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50%
Now he's not
clearing potassium.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50%
I bet it's over 7.5.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50%
- Wait two minutes
for the i-STAT.

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:28.747 position:50%
- If he arrests again,
we might not get him back.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50%
- If it's hypercalcemia,
you could kill him.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50%
Wait.
- Oh, it's my ass, not yours.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50%
- [groaning]

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50%
- Pan scan is negative.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50%
That means you can admit
to orthopedics.

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50%
- But there may have been
a medical etiology

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50%
if she fainted.
- That's not surgical.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50%
Get an internal
medicine consult,

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50%
or admit to medicine
with ortho consulting.

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50%
Either way, I'm off the case.

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50%
- OK.
Thanks for nothing.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50%
- Ancef's in.
I'll grab the gent.

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50%
- Did we figure out
what she's speaking?

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50%
- Last interpreter thought
she might be from Pakistan.

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50%
- There are 77 languages
in Pakistan.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50%
- OK, well, I will buy lunch
for whoever figures it out.

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50%
Good luck.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:14.876 position:50%
If you need me,
I'll be saving lives.

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50%
- That was wicked.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.172 position:50%
- [scoffs] That was gross.
- Yeah.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.800 position:50%
Too much for Little Miss
Crash and Burn.

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:23.343 position:50%
What'd you do with her?
- Nothing.

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:25.845 position:50%
I think she'll be fine.
- Are you kidding?

00:22:25.887 --> 00:22:27.222 position:50%
If that took her out,
she'll be lucky to make it

00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:29.015 position:50%
through this rotation.

00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:30.767 position:50%
I got 50 bucks says she doesn't
last through this shift.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.519 position:50%
- [scoffs]

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.853 position:50%
- Come on.

00:22:33.937 --> 00:22:35.188 position:50%
Put your money
where your mouth is.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.816 position:50%
- Uh, no.
I didn't say anything, OK?

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:40.443 position:50%
And I sure as hell
don't have 50 bucks.

00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:41.861 position:50%
I'll be this lady's age
by the time

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:43.113 position:50%
I pay off my student loans.

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:44.406 position:50%
Not that you're--

00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:50.203 position:50%
- Hey, you want
to sell a kidney?

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:53.498 position:50%
I could get you 30K
as soon as this weekend.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.543 position:50%
That's just between you and me.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:57.919 position:50%
Think about it.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.718 position:50%
- How you doing?

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.428 position:50%
Yeah.

00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:08.346 position:50%
- QRS has narrowed.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.389 position:50%
Much better.

00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:11.224 position:50%
- Potassium is 7.7.

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:13.518 position:50%
Creatinine, 5.6.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.228 position:50%
- High potassium
and renal failure.

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.521 position:50%
Just what you thought.

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:18.231 position:50%
- It must be my lucky day.

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50%
- Ordering 10 units
of regular insulin

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:23.737 position:50%
and 25 grams of glucose.

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:25.572 position:50%
- Why insulin and glucose?

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.365 position:50%
- Shift the potassium
intracellularly.

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:29.075 position:50%
- Exactly, but the definitive
treatment is...

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:30.577 position:50%
- Hemodialysis.
I'll call renal

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.537 position:50%
and get a tech down
with the machine.

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:35.582 position:50%
- Have you ever seen
a dialysis catheter inserted?

00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50%
Dr. Collins is gonna place
a femoral Quinton

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50%
under ultrasound guidance.

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50%
It's an excellent way to learn.

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.921 position:50%
- [groans]
Oh, my chest.

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:43.423 position:50%
- Yeah, we had to shock you.

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:45.258 position:50%
You're gonna be sore
for a while.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50%
- You shocked my heart?

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.471 position:50%
- Long story.
Dr. Collins will fill you in.

00:23:57.103 --> 00:23:59.356 position:50%
You got a sec?

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:03.610 position:50%
You OK?

00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:05.570 position:50%
- Why wouldn't I be?
Are you OK?

00:24:05.653 --> 00:24:07.405 position:50%
- Why wouldn't I be?

00:24:08.823 --> 00:24:10.408 position:50%
You seem annoyed with me
already,

00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:13.119 position:50%
and I just got here.

00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:15.622 position:50%
- It's not always
about you, Robby.

00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:19.334 position:50%
- Am I gonna be OK?

00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:20.919 position:50%
- Yeah.

00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:23.088 position:50%
You just need to take it easy
on yourself.

00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:26.591 position:50%
Muscle breakdown and myoglobin
damaged your kidneys.

00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:28.343 position:50%
- Why'd you shock my heart?

00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:30.970 position:50%
- When your kidneys don't work,
potassium builds up

00:24:31.054 --> 00:24:35.475 position:50%
and messes with the electrical
activity in your heart.

00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:37.769 position:50%
- Can it happen again?

00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:39.729 position:50%
- We gave you medicine
to lower your potassium,

00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:42.273 position:50%
and you'll need dialysis
to clear it all out.

00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:44.150 position:50%
- Then I'll be OK?

00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:45.402 position:50%
- Yeah.

00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:46.820 position:50%
You might need a week or two

00:24:46.861 --> 00:24:49.447 position:50%
for your kidneys to recover,
but yeah.

00:24:49.489 --> 00:24:51.783 position:50%
You really need
to hydrate like crazy

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:54.661 position:50%
before and after a triathlon.

00:24:54.744 --> 00:24:58.331 position:50%
- Trust me,
I won't let this happen again.

00:24:58.415 --> 00:25:01.001 position:50%
- Good.

00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:03.545 position:50%
Be kind to yourself.

00:25:11.803 --> 00:25:14.681 position:50%
- [sighs]
Oh, hey.

00:25:14.723 --> 00:25:16.516 position:50%
Abbot's told me that he's got
a pregnant teen

00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:17.976 position:50%
coming back today
for mifepristone.

00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:19.853 position:50%
Let me know when she gets here.
- Yep.

00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:21.354 position:50%
- Bowel obstruction,
still waiting

00:25:21.396 --> 00:25:23.064 position:50%
on a surgery consult.
What about Garcia?

00:25:23.148 --> 00:25:25.066 position:50%
She was just here
for the traumas.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:29.487 position:50%
- I think she was waiting
for her attending to sign off.

00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.990 position:50%
- OK.

00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:34.659 position:50%
Oh, one of the med students
took a header.

00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:36.119 position:50%
I parked her in the lounge
under the guise

00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:37.537 position:50%
of a work comp report.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.705 position:50%
Will you just go in there,
eyeball her,

00:25:38.747 --> 00:25:40.165 position:50%
and make sure she's all right?

00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:41.207 position:50%
- She's gonna miss
the morning arrival

00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:42.542 position:50%
of the living dead.

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:44.127 position:50%
- How many are we expecting?

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.879 position:50%
- We were getting three,
but one died en route.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.714 position:50%
Don't know who's luckier,
us or them.

00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:49.382 position:50%
- What's open?
- 14.

00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:51.051 position:50%
- 89-year-old woman from a SNF.

00:25:51.092 --> 00:25:53.386 position:50%
History of emphysema, CHF, MS.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.221 position:50%
V-fib, unresponsive
to three shocks.

00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.515 position:50%
Two rounds of epi.
- What is that?

00:25:57.557 --> 00:25:59.059 position:50%
- LUCAS
chest compression system.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.560 position:50%
- Robotic CPR.

00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:03.063 position:50%
[machine thumping]

00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:05.815 position:50%
- Everybody get a hold.
One, two, three.

00:26:08.193 --> 00:26:10.904 position:50%
- [yells]

00:26:10.987 --> 00:26:12.781 position:50%
- Students are dropping
like flies.

00:26:12.864 --> 00:26:14.532 position:50%
- Take a break.
Ice the finger.

00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:16.910 position:50%
- You can count on getting
a couple elderly patients

00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:19.537 position:50%
every day around 7:30,
after the nursing homes

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:21.915 position:50%
and assisted living facilities
do their morning bed checks.

00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:24.084 position:50%
You can practically
set your watch.

00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:25.418 position:50%
- Was there
an advanced directive?

00:26:25.502 --> 00:26:27.420 position:50%
- No, full code,
per the nursing home.

00:26:27.504 --> 00:26:29.714 position:50%
- Seriously?

00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:32.258 position:50%
- LUCAS off.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.718 position:50%
- Still V-fib.

00:26:33.802 --> 00:26:35.261 position:50%
- LUCAS on.

00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:37.681 position:50%
One more round of epi,
one more shock,

00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:38.848 position:50%
and then we call it?

00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:41.935 position:50%
[machine beeping]

00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:44.896 position:50%
- Joseph Spencer, 79.

00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:46.856 position:50%

- To make sure
we check all of our boxes.

00:27:22.976 --> 00:27:25.103 position:50%
The federal government audits
our sepsis bundle performance

00:27:25.186 --> 00:27:26.813 position:50%

take care of the others.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.931 position:50%
- OK, let's move her
to the viewing room

00:28:02.015 --> 00:28:04.434 position:50%
and notify the family.
- Yep.

00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:07.854 position:50%
- One of the things we do here
is to take a moment of silence

00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:11.483 position:50%
when we lose a patient,
to respect their humanity

00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:14.027 position:50%
And also to remember
that this was somebody's child

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:18.239 position:50%

I am so sorry.

00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:36.341 position:50%
- Maybe leave it on vibrate
while you're working.

00:28:39.594 --> 00:28:41.888 position:50%
- Later, Doc.
- You behave yourself now.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.431 position:50%
- Always.

00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:48.144 position:50%
- Your med student's
back on her feet.

00:28:48.228 --> 00:28:50.522 position:50%
How old's that kid?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:51.898 position:50%
- What is she,
some sort of savant?

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.149 position:50%
- I don't know. Maybe.

00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:54.693 position:50%
- Dr. Robinavitch, hi.

00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.027 position:50%
I just wanted to apologize
for any trouble

00:28:56.111 --> 00:28:57.404 position:50%
my clumsiness
might have caused.

00:28:57.445 --> 00:28:58.738 position:50%
I feel ridiculous.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.073 position:50%
- Oh, I can't tell
how many times

00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:01.366 position:50%
I've hit my head
on an overhead lamp.

00:29:01.449 --> 00:29:03.243 position:50%
Twice I needed to get staples.

00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:05.745 position:50%
Why don't you go work
with Dr. McKay in triage?

00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:07.539 position:50%
That would help both of us.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.041 position:50%
- Oh, I--I don't need
special treatment.

00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:11.334 position:50%
- Good,
because I don't give it.

00:29:11.418 --> 00:29:12.669 position:50%
[exhales]

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.588 position:50%
- Look, I know
I might look too young,

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.757 position:50%
but I studied
my ass off to get here.

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.884 position:50%
Probably harder
than the others.

00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:21.302 position:50%
I earned this.

00:29:21.386 --> 00:29:23.471 position:50%
- OK, look, I respect
your dedication

00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:25.390 position:50%
and your determination,
but while you're here,

00:29:25.473 --> 00:29:26.766 position:50%
you're my responsibility.

00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:27.976 position:50%
And when one
of my responsibilities

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:29.644 position:50%
takes a header--wow!

00:29:29.728 --> 00:29:31.146 position:50%
Abbot called
for a surgical consult

00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:32.439 position:50%
on the SBO three hours ago.

00:29:32.522 --> 00:29:33.732 position:50%
You're very lucky
they didn't perf.

00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:35.608 position:50%
- I'm here to see my daughter.

00:29:35.692 --> 00:29:37.110 position:50%
- I'm sorry, is that a patient?

00:29:37.152 --> 00:29:38.737 position:50%
- You're talking to her.

00:29:41.156 --> 00:29:42.574 position:50%
Am I interrupting?

00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:44.117 position:50%
- No.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.286 position:50%
No, we're done.
We're good.

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:48.121 position:50%
Come find me when you're ready
to present your next case.

00:29:48.204 --> 00:29:49.330 position:50%
- Thank you.

00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:53.084 position:50%

00:29:59.674 --> 00:30:00.967 position:50%
- Mm-hmm.

00:30:01.051 --> 00:30:02.886 position:50%
The thing--
- Did she say Crash?

00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:04.137 position:50%
- No.

00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:05.805 position:50%
No, no, it's not crash.

00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:08.433 position:50%
Um, she said crush,
'cause I'm always crushing it.

00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:10.977 position:50%
[chuckles]

00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:12.812 position:50%
Um, thanks for coming down,
Mom, but I've--

00:30:12.854 --> 00:30:14.564 position:50%
I've got a patient.

00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:15.690 position:50%
Bye.

00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:26.826 position:50%
- What do you want?

00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:29.662 position:50%
- Um, I--I just wanted to make
sure you're comfortable.

00:30:29.704 --> 00:30:34.209 position:50%
- I am taking a dump
in a dustpan,

00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:36.169 position:50%
so what's that
fucking tell you?

00:30:36.252 --> 00:30:37.796 position:50%
- Um, I'm--

00:30:37.837 --> 00:30:39.464 position:50%
I'm clearly--
I'm clearly in the wrong room.

00:30:39.547 --> 00:30:40.465 position:50%

00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:42.175 position:50%
