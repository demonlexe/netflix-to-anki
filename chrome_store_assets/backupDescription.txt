// Storage Justification
It utilizes a cache of translations for each movie/show when it batch translates the subtitles. This is saved in local storage and can grow somewhat large if a lot of different shows/episodes/movies are being viewed. Data is stored for 7 days per unique show/movie ID.

// Scripting Justification
The extension must be able to inject a script into the Netflix page to watch for the API Call to be made for subtitles from the Netflix server. It is then intercepted by the code and sent to the background for processing through Gemini.

// Hosting Justificaiton
The extension must have access to Netflix in order to perform the duties, such as translating subtitles, or allowing clicks on subtitles to perform the anki-saving action.
